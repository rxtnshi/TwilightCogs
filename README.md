# ‚öôÔ∏è TwilightCogs

This is my attempt on some cogs using RedBot. I push my updates through here and add them to my own instance.


## ü§î I want to create my own cogs, but how do I start?

I started some tutorials on YouTube and referred to [Red's documentation](https://docs.discord.red/en/stable/guide_cog_creation.html). Some tutorials I referred to can be found here:
- [Creating cogs in discord.py](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYm8enDrgKo)
- [Making a modmail system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72dXuNmqbzM)
